   To do: Might need to transform into a class to automate calling it.
3. Started working on initializing the conv lstm model

26/12/23

2. Attempted to denormalize inputs within cool animation
   Should start to divide that function into multiple ones, making it easier to use
- Lucas and Antionio (2h)
1. Preperation of slides

12/1/24

   The other is only for testing
- All (2h)

- Antonio and Lucas (2.5h)

- Antonio (0.5 h)
1. Run new model

13/1/24
- Antonio and Lucas (1h)
1. Reviewed outputs of 'new' conv lstm model, realised it has the same test loss, even though validation loss was decrease by almost 2 orders of magnitude
- Lucas (4h)
1. Worked on post processing to implement feedback. Made it clearer where BC was located and added a new subplot for loss per frame.
2. Code cleanup, to make functions more versatile and easier to change.

17/1/24
- David (1h)
1. Studying CNN model code and making initial notes for the report

18/1/24
- David (4h)
1. Added way to visualize the model architecture + tested this on the CNN model. Tried (unsuccessfully to make the resulting visualization more legible by grouping blocks. 
2. Wrote sub-sections on CNN data pre-processing, model architecture and model training for the report.

23/1/24
- Lucas (2h)
1. Started implementing more metrics to test the ability of each model
- Antonio (3h)
1. Started implementing data augmentation to reduce the loss of dataset 2. Rotation and flipping were considered. The ease of flipping makes it attractive.

- Lucas (5 h)
1. Finished implementing metrics
2. Worked on making convlstm model only work with a single layer instead of 48
- Antonio (6 h) 
1. Worked on data augmentation
2. Started working on post processing plots to show in which situation the model works better
- Lucas And Antonio (2h)

25/1/24
- Lucas (3.5 h)
1. Succesffuling implemented single layer convlstm model
2. Removed pottential conflicts so that all functions could work regardless of model used
- Antonio (8h)
1. Worked on feedback recieved during yesterday's session
