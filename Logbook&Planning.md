**Project title**:
Spatio-temporal flood modelling with Deep Learning

**Background**:
%%%% to be added

**Objectives**:
%%%% to be added

**Project planning**:
Finish first minimum model by week 2.7 before the Mid-term review.
In the meantime implement at least another model and prepare PowerPoint slides for Mid-term review.

Future works:
- implement other models (by around 18/01);
- apply data augmentation (by around 18/01);
- generalize models to ddatasets 2 & 3 (by aroud 28/01);
- through Delft3D create new datasets (by aroud 28/01).

If time allows it, other models from literature will be explored. 

**Team organisation**:
Apostolos, David, Carlo: input data preparation, CNN model, other to be discussed.
Lucas, Antonio: ConvLSTM model, other to be discussed.

Everyone: PP presentation, report, other to be discussed.

21/12/2023 
- Antonio (1 h). 
1. GitHub repository improvement (folders and files creation). Added datasets and other files from Google Drive.
- Apostolos (1 h). 
1. Further edit on given data for easier implementation on workshop's given CNN python code.
- Apostolos and David. 
1. Presentation of progress to the project's tutor and discussion about further explanation on workshop's given CNN python code.
- Apostolos, David and Carlo (6 h). 
1. Finalization of given dataset edit. 
2. Implementation on workshop's given CNN python code. 
3. First draft CNN model (single step prediction).
- David (1 h).
1. Set up a draft version for the final report + cover page design

22/12/2023 
- Antonio and Lucas (6 h). 
1. Read literature to find a conv LSTM model that used pytorch on github. 
2. Looked through the git folders to see what had been accomplished by other members. 
3. Started implementing CNN model into git, not completed, work can be seen on a seperate branch. 
4. Worked on pre processing all the inputs and targets (including discharge) for all samples and time steps. 
5. Started working on encoding and decoding the csv files to reduce running time of processing the data.

23/12/2023 
- Antonio (4 h). 
1. Input data preprocessing (for training/validation dataset)

24/12/2023
- Lucas and Antonio (3.5 h).
1. Automatization of input data processing for all other datasets
2. Includes git debugging to merge branches

25/12/23
- Lucas (4 h)
1. Worked on post processing the data to ensure data made sense
2. Animation script can be found in conv lstm notebook. Skeleton should be solid. Only need to add more subplots and change the colors.
   To do: Might need to transform into a class to automate calling it.
3. Started working on initializing the conv lstm model

26/12/23
- Lucas (2 h)
1. Worked on train_epoch function for conv lstm model. Not yet functional, but model understands first inputs.
   Having difficulty using the previous outputs as new inputs

30/12/23
- Apostolos (2 h)
1. First attempt on finalizing the first CNN model with 96 outputs instead of 1
- Antonio (1.5 h)
1. Worked on ConvLSTM model.

31/12/23
- Apostolos (3 h)
1. First CNN model with 96 outputs working correctly.

1/1/24
- Apostolos (3 h)
1. Running the first working CNN model multiple times for 48 outputs, figuring out which settings improve the quality of the outcome

8/1/24
- David (1 h)
1. Wrote introduction + notes on dataset sections for the report

9/1/24 - Everyone present (1 h)
1. Progress update
