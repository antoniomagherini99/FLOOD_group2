**Project title**:
Spatio-temporal flood modelling with Deep Learning

**Background**:
%%%% to be added

**Objectives**:
%%%% to be added

**Project planning**:
Finish first minimum model by week 2.7 before the Mid-term review.
In the meantime implement at least another model and prepare PowerPoint slides for Mid-term review.

Future works:
- implement other models (by around 18/01);
- apply data augmentation (by around 18/01);
- generalize models to ddatasets 2 & 3 (by aroud 28/01);
- through Delft3D create new datasets (by aroud 28/01).

If time allows it, other models from literature will be explored. 

**Team organisation**:
Apostolos, David, Carlo: input data preparation, CNN model, other to be discussed.
Lucas, Antonio: ConvLSTM model, other to be discussed.

Everyone: PP presentation, report, other to be discussed.

1. Presentation of progress to the project's tutor and discussion about further explanation on workshop's given CNN python code.
- Apostolos, David and Carlo (6h). 
1. Finalization of given dataset edit. 
2. Implementation on workshop's given CNN python code. 
3. First draft CNN model (single step prediction).

22/12/2023 
- Antonio and Lucas (6h). 
1. Read literature to find a conv LSTM model that used pytorch on github. 
2. Looked through the git folders to see what had been accomplished by other members. 
3. Started implementing CNN model into git, not completed, work can be seen on a seperate branch. 
4. Worked on pre processing all the inputs and targets (including discharge) for all samples and time steps. 
5. Started working on encoding and decoding the csv files to reduce running time of processing the data.
