- Lucas Terlinden-Ruhl - 

**Project title**:
Spatio-temporal flood modelling with Deep Learning

**Background**:
%%%% to be added

**Objectives**:
%%%% to be added

**Project planning**:
Finish first minimum model by week 2.7 before the Mid-term review.
In the meantime implement at least another model and prepare PowerPoint slides for Mid-term review.

Future works:
- implement other models (by around 18/01);
- apply data augmentation (by around 18/01);
- generalize models to ddatasets 2 & 3 (by aroud 28/01);
- through Delft3D create new datasets (by aroud 28/01).

If time allows it, other models from literature will be explored. 

**Team organisation**:
Apostolos, David, Carlo: input data preparation, CNN model, other to be discussed.
Lucas, Antonio: ConvLSTM model, other to be discussed.

Everyone: PP presentation, report, other to be discussed.
