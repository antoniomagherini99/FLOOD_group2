This folder contains the file paths of the ConvLSTM models that were created during the training process.

The model with 4 hidden dim was trained on non augmented data and performs badly on all testing datasets.

The model with 8 hidden dim was trained on augmented data (which had random flipping/rotation applied once to the entire training dataset).
Currently the best performing model.
