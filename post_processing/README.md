This folder contains several .py files used in the post-processing step of both the CNN (if other group members decided to use them) and ConvLSTM model.
This is also where gifs of the models are stored (in the case of the plot_animation function)

# metrics.py: Lucas
This script includes functions for evaluating binary classification metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.

# plots.py: Antonio
This script includes functions for plotting various aspects of the model results, meant to aid in evaluation and understanding the performance of the considered deep learning model.

# cool_animation.py: Lucas
This script includes functions that provide tools for creating animated visualizations to analyze the model's behavior over time for specific samples in the dataset.
